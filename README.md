# Seismic-Hotspot-Identification-using-DBSCAN
Ir analyzes earthquake event data to identify high-risk seismic zones using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm. By grouping spatial earthquake occurrences based on density, the project helps uncover hidden seismic hotspots without requiring predefined cluster counts, enabling effective geospatial risk analysis and decision support.
